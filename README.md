# Data-MultiVector (open-source)
Created, designed, and maintained by Curtis Alfrey
Alpha test phase v 1.0

The main thing, is to keep the main thing, the main thing. 

and THE MAIN THING is to create a tool that will do what a linux symlink command will do, but, with mulitple inputs and/or outputs where symlink only connects 1 input and 1 output......
Data-MultiVector will create, manage, track, and report multiple data location links.


 
2 example pictures of how data can be managed through this system from multiple input directories and output in 1 or more directories.
